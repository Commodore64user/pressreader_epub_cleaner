# PressReader ePub deDuplicator

A Python script to clean and deduplicate ePub newspaper (and magazine) files generated by PressReader. It intelligently handles both raw PressReader ePubs and those that have been converted using Calibre, creating a clean, readable file with no duplicate articles or blank pages.

## The Problem

ePubs generated by PressReader often contain duplicated articles. This can happen for two reasons:
1.  **Contents Previews**: Articles are printed in full in the "Contents" section at the beginning of the book (magazines mainly) and then again in their proper section later on.
2.  **Multi-page Spreads**: For articles that span multiple pages in the print edition, the conversion tool repeats the *entire* article for each physical page, for example, if the print version of an articles takes up 3 pages, the digital conversion is printed 3 times in full, back to back.

This script is designed to fix both issues automatically.

## Features

-   Automatically detects the ePub type (Raw PressReader vs. Calibre-converted).
-   Correctly removes "Contents" section previews (previews are actually full article duplicates) while keeping the articles in their correct section.
-   Correctly removes multi-page spread duplicates, keeping only one article.
-   Deletes now-empty XHTML files to prevent blank pages in the final ePub.
-   Updates the ePub's master manifest (`content.opf`) and Table of Contents (`toc.ncx`) to reflect the removed pages and prevent errors.
-   Provides a summary of removed articles and deleted pages upon completion.

## Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* BeautifulSoup4
* lxml

## Installation

Install the required Python libraries using pip (on macOS):

```bash
python3.13 pip install beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

Download the `.py` from this repo and run the following command from a terminal window

```bash
python3.13 pressreader_deduplicator.py "/path/to/your/newspaper.epub" [--keep-first]
```

for publications that don't have a table of contents section (i.e., broadsheets, tabloids), it is recommended to use the `--keep-first` flag. This will keep the first instance of an article instead of the first of the last continous block. Example: an article might have been printed in full in page 5 (page number matched to physical copy), and again in pages 27, 28 (it's a double page spread, printed in full 3 times). Standard mode will keep the one from page 27 and, keep-first will keep the one in page 5.

Note that for The Economist, the new ePub is roughly two thirds the lenght of the original (487 vs 759 pages) and for The New Yorker, one fifth of the lenght (398 vs 1824 pages), broadsheets and tabloids which tend to have fewer multi-page spreads still benefit but slightly less, roughly a 15pc reduction in this case.
